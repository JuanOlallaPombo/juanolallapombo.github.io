                <p style="text-align:justify;">I am MSc in space systems student with a growing passion for space exploration and for the combination of 
                    Machine Learning and other Artificial Intelligence techniques to the fast-paced space industry. I believe 
                    that these tools can help shape a more efficient, sustainable and versatile panorama where innovative 
                    technological solutions can thrive and be translated into benefits for society. To accomplish that, my vision 
                    is focused on research in dynamical environments that stay close to industrial partners and international institutions.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I received by Bachelor's degree from the Polytechnic University of Madrid, where I am also coursing my Master's. I have
                    combined this with stays in foreign institutions such as the Technical University of Berlin (ERASMUS+) and the
                    Max Planck Institute for Astronomy (master's thesis), and in top European space companies such as Satlantis or
                    DHV Technology.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    My research career has been focused on the applications of Computer Vision and Machine Learning to multiple engineering
                    tasks, from space engineering to biomechanics. I am the first author of a peer-reviewed paper and of another one which
                    is currently under review.
